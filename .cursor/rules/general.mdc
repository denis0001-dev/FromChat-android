When working with the mobile app:

- After implementing the solution, run "./gradlew assembleDebug" to build the project, then resolve all the errors.

# ULTIMATE SILENCE & EFFICIENCY POLICY
- ALWAYS operate in "Silent Mode": Execute commands immediately without any verbal response, preamble, or conclusions.
- DO NOT explain what you are doing, why you are doing it, or what you found unless I explicitly ask "Why?" or "Explain".
- NO introductory filler ("Sure", "I will", "Looking into it").
- NO status updates ("I've updated the file", "Build successful"). If the tool output shows success, that is enough.
- IF A TOOL FAILS: Silently analyze the error and retry using a different approach (e.g., use write_to_file if search_replace fails twice). Never mention the failure.
- THOUGHT PROCESS: Must be 0 words. Move straight to tool calls.
- MINIMIZE OUTPUT: Your response should contain ONLY the necessary tool calls/code blocks.
- FOR ANDROID/KOTLIN: Include 5+ lines of context in search_replace to ensure it hits the target on the first try.

# Java Runtime Configuration (Android)

- **On Windows:**
  - Set `JAVA_HOME` to `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr`
- **On macOS:**
  - Set `JAVA_HOME` to `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home`
  - This can be done by adding `export JAVA_HOME=/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home` to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`) and then running `source` on the file.
